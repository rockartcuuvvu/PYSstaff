# Partnership Requests

This is a page where a clear explanation will be made for how to do a partnership through our partnership request system. We do **not** do partnerships over Modmail. We currently have a system where if a user wants to partner, they can DM `Server Operator#9596` the command `$partnership <server-invite>` , and it should send a message immediately to a channel named, `#🤝partnership-requests`. That should ping the Partnership Team when the message does come through.   
  
_Now, you are probably wondering, what are these reactions on the partnership request and what do they do?_

##                         Reactions

`👍` = Accepting the partnership and the partnership request message should edit to saying you have **accepted** the partnership request.  
  
`👎` = Denying the partnership due to it **not** following our server rules or partnership requirements. The message should edit to saying you have **denied** the partnership request.



###            Accepting a Partnership Request

After clicking the `👍` to accept a partnership request, you will then DM the user that is listed under the `Partnership Representative` field in the embed of the partnership request. You can DM that user something on the lines of...

```text
Hello! We, **PYS (Promote Your Servers)**, have recently recieved a partnership request from you. Do you want to continue this partnership?
```

This will then let the user know that we received their partnership request and continuing the partnership. If they say something on the lines of, `Yes, etc`, you will then **AND ONLY THEN**, send our advertisement to them and ask them for their advertisement. Refer to the [Partnership Team Commands](https://app.gitbook.com/@pys-partnership-guide/s/partnership-guide/~/drafts/-MTaz3d35ijbAufA21ds/partnership-guide/commands) for more info on partnership commands and sending our advertisement and follow the steps in the [Partnership Process](https://app.gitbook.com/@pys-partnership-guide/s/partnership-guide/~/drafts/-MTb09IgkUFb7SNzKc6u/partnership-guide/partnership-proccess) page for finishing the partnership.
