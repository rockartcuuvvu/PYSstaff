# The Point of the Moderation Guide

**The Moderation Team is led by Waggers -** `Waggers#0001` **and Muffin -** `muffin#3427`**, feel free to contact them at any time regarding any questions or queries you may have about the Moderation Team.** 

**The point of the Moderation Team is to ensure that there are no rule-breakers in the server or if any of the Ads posted break our rules for example: Invalid Invites or Incorrect channel. However, that will be explained more later in this guide. In addition, the Moderation Team is there to ensure that everyone has a good time and having fun. They also deal with reports through ModMail however that will be talked about in another Guide. In the Moderation Team there are three different ranks obtainable through promotion you can be all with different permissions and perks. These will be discussed later in the Guide as well. The ranks are: Helper, Moderator, Senior Moderator. This will all be explained** [**here**](untitled-1.md)**.**
