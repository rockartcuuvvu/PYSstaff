# Different Ranks and what they do

**There are 4 ranks in the Moderation Team but only 3 of them are obtainable through promotion and being active. The rank which isn’t obtainable without a promotion and being active is Lead Moderator, the other 3 are Senior Moderator, Moderator and Helper. I’ll go through these in more detail in the table below:**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Helper" %}
**Helper - The beginning role you will receive as soon as you have been hired into the Moderation Team. Very basic permissions you can warn and mute not able to ban.**
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Moderator" %}
**Moderator - The middle rank you will receive, you have the same permissions as Helper but you are able to ban. You can receive this role through a promotion. You just need to have a good number of good ratings.**
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Senior Moderator" %}
**Senior Moderator - The top rank you can receive with a general promotion. They have the exact same permissions as Moderators. This is a very prestigious rank and not many people have this role. In order to receive this role you would have to be very hard and be recognised by the Moderation Team. These are the people to ask about general questions about the Moderation Team.**
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Lead Moderator" %}
**Lead Moderator - These people are in charge of the Moderation Team. They will do the weekly Staff Checks for the Team and ask people to be more active. Please do what they ask you to do. They are the people who also Hire and Fire staff members for the Moderation Team. You wouldn’t want them to regret the decision of hiring you. This position is very difficult to get and you must be selected by the Management Team.**
