# Whatâ€™s expected of you

**You are expected to remain active throughout the time of you being a member of staff here at Promote Your Servers. Slacking in no means is permitted whatsoever. If you know you are going to be inactive be sure to request a break in the desired channel in the Staff Server.**

**You are expected to do 5 AD Moderations a week i.e. posting 5 different warns in \#ðŸ›‘advertisement-moderation\_staff and send a message in \#ðŸ’¬general-lounge. This will get you a Decent rating. Anything less than this will guarantee you are Bad Rating in the Staff Checks. For a good rating itâ€™s up to you if you are wanting that rating bad enough. We will not set any parameters for this. For more information on the Staff Checks be sure to check out \[Link Staff Checks Section here\].**
