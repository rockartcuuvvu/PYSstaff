# What is expected of you

**You are expected to remain active throughout the time of you being a member of staff here at Promote Your Servers. Slacking in no means is permitted whatsoever. If you know you are going to be inactive be sure to request a break in** âŒšrequest-for-breaks **in the Staff Server.  You can find more about breaks here**  


**You are expected to do 5 AD Moderations a week i.e. posting 5 different warns in \#ðŸ›‘advertisement-moderation\_staff and send a message in \#ðŸ’¬general-lounge. This will get you a Decent rating. Anything less than this will guarantee you are Bad Rating in the Staff Checks. For a good rating itâ€™s up to you if you are wanting that rating bad enough. We will not set any parameters for this rating. Which leaves it up to you what figure out how much we want you to do. For more information on the Staff Checks be sure to check out \[Link Staff Checks Section here\].**
