# Partnership Proccess



This is a page where a clear explanation will be made for how to do a partnership correctly. We do **not** do partnerships over modmail. We currently have a system where if a user wants to partner, they can DM `Server Operator#9596` the command `$partnership <server-invite>` , and it should send a message immediately to a channel named, `#ü§ùpartnership-requests` . That should ping the `Partnership Team` when the message does come through.   
  
If a user DMs you asking to partner with us and meets our partnership requirements, follow the following steps...  


* [ ] Greet the user kindly and ask for their advertisement 
* [ ] Tell the user you will send our advertisement to them either or through the command `$ad <user-mention/ID>` or send it to them manually 
* [ ] After they send their advertisement and you send our advertisement, you need to make sure their server follows [Discord ToS](https://discord.com/terms), our [Server Rules](https://discord.com/channels/611881570202025986/611882134436577290/805921432285741078), & our [Partnership Requirements](https://discord.com/channels/611881570202025986/780558940148203553/810944425579511818). Then, ask the user for a screenshot of them posting out advertisement 
* [ ] You can lastly, post their advertisement, use the [Partner Role](https://app.gitbook.com/@pys-partnership-guide/s/partnership-guide/partnership-guide/commands) commands to give them their partner role, and send a DM to the user that their advertisement has been posted in the partnership channel or send them the message link for their advertisement being posted.
