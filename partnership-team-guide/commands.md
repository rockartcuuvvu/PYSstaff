# Commands

This is a page where you will see all of the commands you can use to handle partnership and make your life easier while doing them. All commands start with a prefix, `$`. As well as the commands are done through our private server bot, `Server Operator#9596`. If you are wondering if you can invite the bot to your own server, the answer is _**no.**_
